  abstract = {Validity is the most important quality of an assessment, but its evaluation is often neglected. The step-by-step approach suggested hereprovides structured guidance to validators of educational assessments. Assessment is depicted as a chain of eight linked stages: administration, scoring, aggregation, generalization, extrapolation, evaluation, decision and impact. Evaluating validity requires careful consideration of threats to validity associated with each link. Several threats are described and exemplified for each link. These sets of threats are intended to be illustrative rather than comprehensive. The chain model suggests that validity is limited by the weakest link, and that efforts to make other links particularly strong may be wasteful or even harmful. The chain model and list of threats is also shown to be valuable when planning assessments.},

Among the important hurdles to be surpassed, one must obtain an estimate of one or more error variances, and specify an effect size of importance. There is the temptation to take some shortcuts. This paper offers some suggestions for successful and meaningful sample-size determination. Also discussed is the possibility that sample size may not be the main issue, that the real goal is to design a high-quality study. Finally, criticism is made of some ill-advised shortcuts relating to power and sample size.},

  abstract = {The paper analyzes conceptualizations in the science frameworks in three large-scale assessments, Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The assessments have a shared history, but have developed different conceptualizations. The paper asks how and why the frameworks are different and seeks answers by studying their development. The methodology is document analysis by, first, tracing developments within each assessment, next, comparing developments and conceptualization across the assessments, and, last, relating the frameworks to trends of developments in educational theory. The outcome of the analysis provides a complex picture with the assessments following their own lines of development but with influence from trends in assessment and educational theory. Five main conceptualizations are found to have existed over time, with different definition of scientific behavior and explanations to the relationship between knowledge and behavior. The frameworks have moved toward more elaborated explanations of the science domain, providing assessors with better support for operationalizing learning objectives. Currently, the assessments are faced with a challenge of adapting to the ``practice turn'' in science studies and learning science and thereby accounting for scientific behavior as a community practice. The paper concludes with suggestions for how frameworks may be improved to achieve this aim. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 97:671\textendash{}694, 2013},

  abstract = {Substantial variation has been observed across an international series of studies examining the consistency of students' explanations of force and the most common meanings of force apparent in those explanations. On the surface, the variations among studies might be attributed to differences at the national level, but the studies also demonstrate differences among students from different schools in the United States. To what degree, therefore, can these variations be attributed to differences in educational systems as opposed to demographic differences or random variation? The current study compares student interviews across two cities in Turkey to provide insight into this question because Turkey, unlike the United States, has a strongly standardized national educational system. The results demonstrate no significant differences in students' consistency or meanings of force between cities. The results, however, demonstrate the expected differences across ages and majors, which suggest that the study has sufficient power. Thus, while differences have been observed between every city and country in the previous studies, and differences are observed in the current study in terms of grade level and academic majors, no differences are observed between the cities in Turkey. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of ongoing conceptual change research.},

  abstract = {This study used base-year data from a large and nationally representative data base (NELS:88) to identify some important explanatory factors for gender differences in science performance. Middle school science classes were selected for study because students have little choice over their coursework at this level. By separating a standardized test of general science achievement into its life science and physical science domains, we documented a large advantage for boys on the subtest of physical science and a modest advantage for girls in life science. Importantly, in physical science, the disadvantage for girls is more pronounced for the most able students. Explanations for these gender difference focus on laboratory experience. Only about 25\% of eighth graders' science classes provide laboratory experiences at least weekly, and these experiences are more common in stand-alone middle schools enrolling more affluent students. Such laboratory experiences are especially beneficial for girls' achievement in physical science, but not boys'. We conclude that these results argue for increasing experiential and hands-on learning in middle school science classes\textemdash{}particularly in the physical sciences\textemdash{}as a means to promote gender equity in science achievement at this important educational level. The study has implications for the underrepresentation of women in physical science careers. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

We found that most of the students supported some form of SCR and reported that their sources were credible and contained more factual information than opinions. Students critiqued the language of the authors, as well as status in their respective fields, along with the content within each source. Additionally, students reported that their sources influenced their content knowledge, but had little influence regarding their SCR opinions. Through this work, we present a new working model and suggest the need for additional research about the understudied interface of opinion, understanding and evaluation within the context of important socioscientific issues. Students' opinions and content knowledge, located at the model's centre, influence and are influenced by the research topic, the sources used, the evaluation criteria and the evaluation of the sources that students use to provide evidence for claims.},

We used NVivo7 software to develop categories, code student responses, and run queries. We identified a continuum of positions that students took regarding the support or opposition of stem cell research, and we found students used eight different perspectives as lenses to form their decisions: medical application, ethical, rights, economic, religious, personal anecdotes, political, or scientific. The most common perspective was `medical application'. Most students relied upon multiple perspectives when making their decisions. We found that when students used multiple viewpoints, the perspectives were unequally valued, generally relying more on ethical perspectives. Scientific perspectives were not common. These findings have implications for improving instruction by focusing the curriculum toward integrating scientific perspectives with non-scientific perspectives held.},

Very few studies have investigated learners' ideas about biotechnology. Our study was designed to understand the types of alternative conceptions students hold concerning SCR. The qualitative research design allowed us to examine college students' understandings about stem cells and SCR. More specifically, we addressed the following questions: How can alternative conceptions about stem cell topics be categorized? What types of alternative conceptions are most common? Participants included 132 students enrolled in a biotechnology course that focused on the scientific background of biotechnology applications relevant to citizens. In this study, we used an inductive approach to develop a taxonomy of alternative ideas about SCR by analyzing student responses to multiple open-ended data sources. We identified five categories of conceptions: alternative conceptions about what, alternative conceptions about how, alternative conceptions about medical potential, terminology confusion, and political and legal alternative conceptions. In order to improve instruction, it is important to understand students' ideas when entering the classroom. Our findings highlight a need to teach how science can be applied to societal issues and improve science literacy and citizenship.},

Two goals of the instruction were to: (1) help students construct accurate scientific ideas, and (2) enhance their reasoning about socioscientific issues. The course structure included interactive lectures, case discussions, hands-on activities, and independent projects. Overall, students' understandings of stem cells, stem cell research, and cloning increased from pre-test to post-test. For example, on the post-test, students gained knowledge concerning the age of an organism related to the type of stem cell it possesses. However, we found that some incorrect ideas that were evident on the pre-test persisted after instruction. For example, before and after instruction several students maintained the idea that stem cells can currently be used to produce organs.},

This study generated a framework for conceptualizing metacognition in groups by describing likely components of group metacognition.

The purpose of the PBL course was to help students gain useful concepts from the learning sciences to apply to teaching. I investigated forms of metacognition and the role reflective discourse played during the learning process. The group and facilitator were videotaped during PBL sessions. A segment of video to study further was identified through interaction analysis. I analyzed the discourse of this segment of the transcribed group discussion, and I examined the group's final paper. Supplementary data sources included the interaction analysis transcript of the full 8-h videotape and, specifically, the comments the group made about the resources they used to solve the problem. Categories of group metacognition were identified, claims proposed, and recombined or rejected until saturation. I identified three components of group metacognition that helped the group members solve the instructional redesign problem: (1) metasocial awareness about other member's expertise, (2) monitoring of understanding, and (3) monitoring of process.

With the increasing availability of the Internet, it is even more essential that students learn how to evaluate the science they gather from online resources. This is particularly true because publishing information on the web is not restricted to experts, and content quality can vary greatly across websites. The responsibility of evaluating websites falls upon the user. Little research has examined undergraduates' evaluation of web sites in science classes. The purpose of this study was to investigate on which websites college students selected and how they evaluated the websites used when developing individual positions about stem-cell research. We used a qualitative approach in search of patterns in undergraduates' website selection and evaluation criteria. We found that students used a variety of web resources from eleven types of websites to complete their independent research report. Students also used eleven evaluation criteria to evaluate these sources, some useful (e.g., credibility) and some not useful (e.g., readability). We found that university students struggled with critically evaluating online resources. Undergraduates need prompts to learn how to critically evaluate the science content provided within websites. This type of scaffold can facilitate useful evaluation and promote critical thinking required for becoming scientifically literate.},

We examined how the preservice teachers understood assessment tools as well as their reasons for using assessment. Additionally, we investigated how the preservice teachers incorporated assessments into inquiry-based science units. Analysis of these documents indicated that preservice teachers recognize the need to align assessments with learning goals and instructional strategies and are using a variety of assessments. They understood several ways to use assessment for learning. However, the inclusion of assessments contained within the science units did not fully align with the views of assessment the preservice teachers presented in their teaching philosophies or journals. Instead of using a variety of assessments that reflect science reforms, the preservice teachers reverted to traditional forms of assessment in their science units. Teacher education programs need to place more emphasis on developing preservice teachers' assessment literacy so that they are better able to select and implement a variety of appropriate assessments to foster student learning.},

  abstract = {This study illustrated a pathway of growth that a preservice teacher might traverse when learning to use and develop equitable assessments (EA). The study is rare in that it looks at the development of preservice teachers' understanding and ability to design EA. I examined the understanding and implementation of EA of 23 secondary preservice teachers within two classes. The methods classes focused on the academic content area of science. Participants' journals, teaching philosophies, and inquiry-based science units served as data sources. Participants progressed from a simple view of EA as ``fairness'' to a more sophisticated view of EA, including: ways to increase fairness, the importance of challenging students, and using assessments for learning. Results also showed changes in preservice teachers' views of learners and the purpose of assessment. While understanding developed robustly, teachers' assessment plans in their units were not as strong. Teacher education programs need to place more emphasis on developing critical understanding of EA practices to meet the needs of diverse learners.},

We investigated middle school teachers' predictions, interpretations, and recommended actions for formative assessment in genetics. Results documented a variety of ways that teachers would elicit students' ideas in genetics, focusing on discussion strategies. Findings showed how well teachers predicted student conceptions compared to actual student conceptions. We also found that teachers mostly described general topics they would use to address students' alternative conceptions. Less often, they explained specific content they would use to challenge ideas or pedagogical strategies for conceptual change. Teachers also discussed barriers to addressing ideas. Teacher professional development should provide more support in helping teachers close the formative assessment cycle by addressing conceptions that are elicited with assessments.},

Using multiple sources of data\textemdash{}expert reviews, a conceptual test blueprint, student interviews, focus group interviews, and student responses to assessments\textemdash{}we were able to analyze the extent to which our assessments align with research-based design principles. Specifically, our results demonstrate that the assessments: (a) align with learning and instructional goals; (b) are cognitively challenging; (c) support student learning; and (d) have reduced potential bias. These assessments were developed in the context of an introductory biochemistry course for nonbiochemistry majors with learning goals in areas of: scientific content, socio-scientific issues, and evidence-based decision making skills. The assessment design principles and development model are generalizable to other science disciplines. We discuss how the application of these design principles can generate valid and reliable embedded assessments that can be integrated into a modern classroom.

Items about the relevance of science to students' lives were developed, pilot-tested, and analyzed using Rasch modeling. We then divided reliable items into three equivalent questionnaire forms. The final three forms of the questionnaire were used to assess high school students' attitudes. Over 18 weeks, one class used a core curriculum (Science and Sustainability) to learn science in the context of making decisions about societal issues. A second class used the same core curriculum, but with parts replaced by computer-based activities (Convince Me) designed to enhance the coherence of students' arguments. Using traditional and Rasch modeling techniques, we assessed the degrees to which such instructional activities promoted students' beliefs that science is relevant to them. Both classes tended to agree more, over time, that science is relevant to their lives, and the increases were statistically equivalent between classes. This study suggests that, by using innovative, issue-based activities, it is possible to enhance students' attitudes about the relevance of science. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Identifying students' conceptual scientific understanding is difficult if the appropriate tools are not available for educators. Concept inventories have become a popular tool to assess student understanding; however, traditionally, they are multiple choice tests. International science education standard documents advocate that assessments should be reform based, contain diverse question types, and should align with instructional approaches. To date, no instrument of this type targeting student conceptions in biotechnology has been developed. We report here the development, testing, and validation of a 35-item Biotechnology Instrument for Knowledge Elicitation (BIKE) that includes a mix of question types. The BIKE was designed to elicit student thinking and a variety of conceptual understandings, as opposed to testing closed-ended responses. The design phase contained nine steps including a literature search for content, student interviews, a pilot test, as well as expert review. Data from 175 students over two semesters, including 16 student interviews and six expert reviewers (professors from six different institutions), were used to validate the instrument. Cronbach's alpha on the pre/posttest was 0.664 and 0.668, respectively, indicating the BIKE has internal consistency. Cohen's kappa for inter-rater reliability among the 6,525 total items was 0.684 indicating substantial agreement among scorers. Item analysis demonstrated that the items were challenging, there was discrimination among the individual items, and there was alignment with research-based design principles for construct validity. This study provides a reliable and valid conceptual understanding instrument in the understudied area of biotechnology.},

Epistemic beliefs can influence reasoning, how individuals evaluate information, and informed decision making abilities. These skills are important for an informed citizenry that will participate in debates regarding areas in science such as biotechnology. We report on an in-depth case study analysis of three undergraduate, non-science majors in a biotechnology course designed for non-biochemistry majors. We selected participants who performed above average and below average on the first in-class exam. Data from multiple sources\textemdash{}interviews, exams, and a concept instrument\textemdash{}were used to construct (a) individual profiles and (b) a cross-case analysis of our participants' conceptual development and epistemic beliefs from two different theoretical perspectives\textemdash{}Women's Ways of Knowing and the Reflective Judgment Model. Two independent trained researchers coded all case records independently for both theoretical perspectives, with resultant initial Cohen's kappa values above .715 (substantial agreement), and then reached consensus on the codes. Results indicate that a student with more sophisticated epistemology demonstrated greater conceptual understandings at the end of the course than a student with less sophisticated epistemology, even though the latter performed higher initially. Also a student with a less sophisticated epistemology and low initial conceptual performance does not demonstrate gains in their overall conceptual understanding. Results suggest the need for instructional interventions fostering epistemological development of learners in order to facilitate their conceptual growth.},

  abstract = {Sweden is today an immigrant country with more than 14\% foreign born. An increasing share of the immigrants comes from non-European countries. This implies that Sweden has been transformed from an ethnically homogenous country into a country with a large visible minority. In this paper we survey the effect of this change on school segregation. Building on Schelling's model for residential segregation, we argue that establishment of a visible minority has triggered a process of school segregation that in some respects can be compared with the developments in the United States. In order to test the validity of a Schelling-type process in Swedish schools we compare segregation levels in regions with different shares of visible minority students. We use data from the PISA 2003 survey in combination with register data on the ethnic composition of student population in different parts of Sweden. We find that school segregation is higher in regions with a large visible-minority population. We also find that, controlling for student background, there are smaller differences in performance across schools in regions with low shares of minority students.},

Consequently, a large share of today's students attend a school other than the one closest to home. Since the compulsory school system is designed to be free of charge and to offer the same standard of education everywhere, increasing school choice- hypothetically-should not increase the between-school variation in grades. In reality, however, between-school variation in grades has increased in recent years. The aim of this paper is to test whether increasing between-school variance can be explained by changes in residential patterns, or if it must be attributed to structural change. Using a counterfactual approach, the students' variations in grades are compared between observed schools of graduation and hypothetical schools of graduation. The multilevel results indicate that school choice seems to increase between-school variation of grades. Adapted from the source document.},

The two-hour test on reading, mathematics and science is administered every year and rotated among those three subject areas; thus the reading test would be administered every three years, then the maths test in the following year, then the science test in the year following that. Where PISA differs from many tests of achievement is that it aims to test young people's ability to use their knowledge and skills in order to meet real-life challenges. For example, the asses ...},

Most pupils, especially boys, did not like to read aloud. Even many fluent and motivated readers felt embarrassed when doing it. Pupils' attitudes towards writing were more negative than those regarding reading. Boys were significantly more reluctant writers than girls. To interest boys the writing task should have a meaningful purpose or a communicative function. The results suggest that pupils' interest should be a key factor in the selection of reading material; otherwise, many students will avoid reading and may develop a lifelong aversion to it.},

Skolan kommunalise- rades, m{\aa}l- och resultatstyrning inf{\"o}rdes samt fritt skolval och etablering av fri- st{\aa}ende skolor till{\"a}ts. I denna rapport unders{\"o}ker vi betydelsen av dessa skol- reformer f{\"o}r utvecklingen i den svenska skolan. Vi beskriver den kommunala skolpolitiken, resursf{\"o}rdelningen till skolan, och den framv{\"a}xande skolmarkna- den. Vi f{\"o}rs{\"o}ker belysa reformernas betydelse f{\"o}r skolans resultat och elevsor- tering. En viktig slutsats {\"a}r att resultatnedg{\aa}ngen i den svenska skolan p{\aa}b{\"o}rja- des redan f{\"o}re skolreformerna, men att vi inte kan utesluta att reformerna p{\aa}- verkat den fortsatta utvecklingen. Andelen elever som inte avslutar gymnasiet {\"o}kade till f{\"o}ljd av programgymnasiet och det nya betygssystemet, men dessa elever tycks {\"a}nd{\aa} ha deltagit i undervisningen. Betygsskillnaderna mellan sko- lor har v{\"a}xt markant sedan 1990-talet, men kan n{\"a}stan helt f{\"o}rklaras av {\"o}kande elevsortering snarare {\"a}n av skillnader i skolornas kvalitet. Den tilltagande elev- sorteringen i grundskolan kan i sin tur kopplas till {\"o}kande boendesegregation, men beror till viss del ocks{\aa} p{\aa} friskolevalet. Elevers familjebakgrund har inte f{\aa}tt st{\"o}rre betydelse f{\"o}r betygen i grundskolan {\"a}n tidigare. D{\"a}remot {\"o}kade fa- miljens betydelse sannolikt f{\"o}r gymnasiebetygen i samband med gymnasiere- formerna.

The data derive from The Evaluation Through Follow Up longitudinal project. Through a national curriculum change one group of students received grades and one group of students did not receive grades in the 6th Grade, while both groups of students received grades in the 7th Grade. A quasi-experimental design was thus created, with two comparable groups of students. The subjects were 8558 students born in 1967. Several multiple regression models were fitted to the data. The results showed no main effects of grading on subsequent achievement, but there were important differential effects: graded students with low cognitive ability received lower subsequent grades. The results also showed interaction effects between gender and grading and between gender and cognitive ability.},

  abstract = {This article describes how sociocultural theories can be used to gain knowledge of why, in international knowledge comparisons such as the PISA, it seems so dif cult for Swedish students to answer test questions in scienti c literacy ``correctly''. Sociocultural concepts (interaction, contexts, cultural tools, social languages, resistance, and situatedness), which I mean can contribute to understanding what might take place in the encounter between students and test items, are discussed and illus- trated with two brief examples from an ongoing dissertation project. The article also describes the motive for the chosen research design: to study an encounter between 15 year old students collaboratively working with a few selected PISA items on scienti c literacy. Possible consequences of the items being embedded in ``everyday contexts'' and the signi cance of mastering a scienti c discourse are discussed. Finally I ask which image of science the students are afforded by the test items.},

  doi = {10.2304/eerj.2008.7.1.1},
  abstract = {Large-scale survey studies of educational achievement are becoming increasingly frequent, and they are visibly present in both educational policy debates and within the educational research community. One main aim of these studies is to provide descriptions of inputs, processes and outcomes, and another aim is to provide explanations of how different factors interrelate to produce educational outcomes. These aims are difficult to reach, which in combination with the fact that the comparative studies are typically more policy driven than theory driven, are reasons why these studies are contested on quality grounds. In this article, a set of fundamental methodological challenges related to the validity of the measurement instruments and to the possibility of making inferences about causality are identified and discussed in relation to examples of different studies. Strengths and weaknesses of different research approaches are discussed, and it is proposed that the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative approaches should be replaced with distinctions between low-and high-level inference approaches with respect to data, generalization and explanation. It is concluded that while the international studies easily invite misuse and misinterpretation, they also offer possibilities for improving the quality of educational research, because the high-quality data generated by these studies can be taken advantage of in research on causal effects of factors in and out of educational systems.},

In Sweden, the assessment of socio-scientific argumentation has been a major part of the National Assessment during three consecutive years and this study utilizes data on student performance to investigate (a) the relationship between tasks primarily addressing argumentation and tasks addressing primarily content knowledge as well as (b) students' performance on argumentation tasks, which differ in relation to content, subject, aspect of argumentation and assessment criteria. Findings suggest a strong and positive relationship between content knowledge and students' performance on argumentation tasks. The analysis also provides some hypotheses about the task difficulty of argumentation tasks that may be pursued in future investigations.},
