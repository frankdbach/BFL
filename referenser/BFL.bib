  abstract = {During three discussion sessions, two groups offive teachers each developed a shared lessonplan, one for each group, for the teaching of adifficult economic concept, the incidence of asales tax. In one of the groups (the lessonstudy group), the lesson plan was based on thepool of the participants' experience andintuition in accordance with the Japanese``lesson study''. In the other group (thelearning study group), the lesson plan wasbased on the participants' experience andintuition as made sense of in terms of alearning theory introduced by a researcher inaccordance with the idea of ``the learningstudy'', in which the Japanese lesson study iscombined with a ``design experiment''. Thestudents' understanding was probed after theseries of lessons. In the classes of the lessonstudy group, fewer than 30\% of the studentsdeveloped a good grasp of the concept, comparedto over 70\% of the students in the learningstudy group. The differences in learningoutcomes are interpreted in the light ofobserved differences in how the concept wasdealt with in the different classrooms.},

  abstract = {The idea that formative assessments embedded in a curriculum could help guide teachers toward better instructional practices that lead to greater student learning has taken center stage in science assessment research. In order to embed formative assessments in a curriculum, curriculum developers and assessment specialists should collaborate to create these assessment tasks. This article describes the development of the formal embedded formative assessments and implementation plans for the collaborative research study. It describes the fundamental shift away from ``summative assessment scripts'' to formative assessments lesson scripts. Assessment tasks and implementation plans are described along with the rationale for why these tasks were selected and where these tasks were placed in the curriculum. Finally, we conclude about how to embed formative assessments in new or existing curricula and how to help teachers use these assessments successfully. We point out the critical importance of collaboration and professional development aimed at enabling teachers to re-conceptualize the role of assessments in their teaching, linking formative assessments to overall goals, and providing a learning trajectory as reference for teachers to locate students' ideas in the trajectory and provide feedback accordingly.},

  abstract = {Our project to embed formative student assessments in the Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching curriculum required a close collaboration between curriculum developers at the Curriculum Research \&amp; Development Group (CRDG) and assessment developers at the Stanford Educational Assessment Laboratory (SEAL). This was a new endeavor for each organization, and throughout the project, many lessons were learned about embedding assessments and about the collaboration process. In this article, we discuss what we learned about the strengths and weaknesses of the collaboration up to the beginning of the randomized experiment. What we found comported with the literature on research collaborations. For example, past collaborations between CRDG and SEAL facilitated moving the project forward and sustained the collaboration. That said, the physical distance between the groups gave rise to some misunderstandings and led to a commitment to meet face-to-face on a regular basis; we found that conferencing software did not suffice. Moreover, in our zeal to implement formative assessments, the voices of teachers and teacher trainers got muffled until a pilot study confirmed their advice.},

  abstract = {Given the current emphasis on conducting high-quality experimental studies, it is becoming increasingly important for researchers to accompany their studies with evaluations of the \emph{fidelity of implementation} of the experimental treatments. This article compares the form and extent of an experimental treatment to student learning. The study involved six middle-school physical science teachers and their students. Videotaped lessons were coded according to their alignment with the treatment's intended structure and processes; results identified a 0.71 correlation between teachers' enactment of formative assessment and student learning. The article suggests that the results of the study may have been due, at least in part, to the failure of many of the experimental-group teachers to implement the treatment as intended.},

  abstract = {Assessment of and for learning has occupied center stage in education reform, especially with the advent of the No Child Left Behind Federal legislation. This study examined the formative function of assessment\textemdash{}assessment for learning\textemdash{}recognizing that such assessment needs to be aligned, at least in part, with the summative function of assessment\textemdash{}indexing achievement against standards and progress. Black and Wiliam (1998) suggested that formative assessment might very well improve student learning. Based on these ideas and our own experience with reform science education, we hypothesized that for a small investment of resources we might have a major impact on achievement by embedding formative assessments in a nationally used curriculum. To this end we created a collaboration, described here, between curriculum and assessment developers, created embedded, formative assessments, and studied the impact of science teachers teaching with these materials on middle-school students' motivation, achievement, and conceptual change in a small randomized trial. We also studied the collaboration itself with the intent of informing others who might wish to enter into such collaboration about the potential strengths and challenges experienced. The articles that follow in this special issue report in detail what we did and found out; this article provides a rationale and overview for the study.},

  abstract = {Formative assessment was hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on students' science achievement and conceptual change, either directly or indirectly by enhancing motivation. We designed and embedded formatives assessments within an inquiry science unit. Twelve middle-school science teachers with their students were randomly assigned either to an experimental group (N = 6), provided with embedded formative assessment, or control group (N = 6). Teachers varied significantly as to their impact on student motivation, achievement, and conceptual change. But the impact of the formative assessment treatment on these outcomes was not statistically significant. Variation in both teachers' classroom management and the degree to which they used informal formative assessment, regardless of group, were conjectured as possible reasons for the absence of an overall formative assessment effect.},
